## What is FigminXR?

FigminXR is something like a 3D art app that allows anyone to create their own Mixed Reality holograms. With it, you can create art, games, digital storefronts, and more. It heavily builds on another AR art program called Tilt Brush, which on its own is more suited to making simple 3D models and art, whereas FigminXR adds capabilities such as physics, mixed reality and gamification. It launched on the Quest Pro and Quest 2 very recently (Oct 25th), so I'm hoping more people can learn about it and have fun with it.
